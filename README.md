i want the index view to get and overhall, the index view now only ask for the name by searching for it, the only possible options are : tjark, luca, sarah, cecilia, flora, aditi, alex, folke, ms. king, the names have values, evry name apart from ms king has the value 12k ms king has the vlaue teacher, the value should be saved to the name, when a name has the value 12k then they should jump to the student ui, the student ui should have profill settings, the teacher sign out has to be a seperate, cloned from the student sign out, the teachers should be able to sign out aswell
